VF gripper V2: simulates the gripper with a base within the simscape

Gripper Trajectory Algorithm: Basic gripper control, realise rotation between -180 to 180 degrees. 

Gripper Control: Developed a control algorithm that successfully removed the error throughout the process.

Smooth Motion Function: Plots the motion of consecutive straight-line trajectories in 3D, with samples in time.
